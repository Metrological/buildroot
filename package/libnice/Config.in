	  Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity
	  Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal
	  Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).

	  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library,
	  libstun as well as GStreamer elements.

	  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP
	  data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides
	  security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create
	  reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.

	  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol
	  (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
