	A flexible cross-platform WebRTC client framework based on GStreamer.

	OpenWebRTC is built on the belief that the WebRTC standard would
	transcend the pure browser environment and that native apps,
	implementing the same protocols and API's, would become an important
	part of the WebRTC ecosystem. This is especially true on mobile
	platforms where native app distribution is often preferred over pure
	web apps. Native OpenWebRTC apps can either talk to other native apps
	or browsers that support WebRTC. OpenWebRTC can also provide the
	WebRTC-backend to web browsers.

	Having independent, interoperable, implementations is important for
	the health of any standard, and WebRTC is no exception. The ambition
	of OpenWebRTC is to follow the WebRTC standard closely as it continues
	to evolve.
